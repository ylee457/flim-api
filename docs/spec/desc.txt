Back End Challenge

Being an SVOD service, we have film data that we need to surface through an API. Your challenge is to create a simple API application using Ruby on Rails (or the web development framework of your choice) for retrieving film data and submitting film ratings.

The application should provide the following functionality:

    RESTful endpoints for retrieving a list of films or an individual film
    Support for allowing a user to rate a specific film
    Include average rating for a film as one of its attributes
    Requests and responses should follow the JSON API specification

Please see films.json for sample film data. Please provide tests where reasonable.

We don't expect you to have a perfect solution in the time allotted. Do as much as is reasonable to demonstrate your technical abilities. Please submit your work by sending us a link to a GitHub repo with your code.

Bonus points for the following:

    Support pagination
    Support filtering/sorting
    Support for only retrieving the attributes as listed in the request
    Document the end points (options that can be passed, etc)
    Provide all the documentation we'd need to run the application
